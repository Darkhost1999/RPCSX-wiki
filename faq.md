## What is RPCSX?

**A:** RPCSX is an experimental emulator for PS4 games (and later, PS5 games). Development is ongoing.

## Can I play Bloodborne?

**A:** Not yet.

## Can I run RPCSX on Windows?

**A:** No, currently the project is Linux-only. However, we may support Windows in the future due to popular demand.

### What about the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)?

**A:** Testers have gotten WSL working and we are awaiting instructions for others to use WSL as well. Coming soon. Please be patient.

## What is the current state of the project?

**A:** The emulator can run test samples and play in-game on [We Are Doomed](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2195-CUSA01783_00-WEAREDOOMED00000).
A compatibility table is in progress and will be available when RPCSX can run commercial games.
