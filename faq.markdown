## What is this?

**A:** RPCSX is an experimental emulator for PS4 games (and later, PS5 games). Development is ongoing.

## Bloodborne is not ready to be played yet.

## What is the current state of the project?

The emulator can run a few test samples, and can get to the loading screen of [We Are Doomed](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2195-CUSA01783_00-WEAREDOOMED00000). A compatibility table is in the works, and will likely arise when RPCSX is able to properly run commercial games.

## Where can I get in touch with developers and community members?

See [the project's discord server](https://discord.com/invite/mx8FbxN5).

## How can I help?
